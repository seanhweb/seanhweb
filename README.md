## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sean Houlihan. I am a web developer from Southern California. I strongly believe in open source and making the internet an easier place to navigate for everyone.

I have always had a strong interest in computers and technology growing up, and that had a great influence on my education ambitions. I started out learning web development at the Art Institute of California â€“ Inland Empire, and became a student worker in the Technology department.

I assisted the Technology Department by creating web-based tools that simplify bar code and asset tag creation for equipment checkout and check in, and served the campus by operating a technology service window where students could print their projects and check out equipment relevant to their major. I also assisted IT department during campus off-hours in computer maintenance.

After that, I landed an internship at KVCR Public Media in San Bernardino. I work on several of their websites and web based tools to make life easier.
