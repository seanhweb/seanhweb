## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sean Houlihan. I am a web developer from Southern California. I strongly believe in open source and making the internet an easier place to navigate for everyone.

I have always had a strong interest in computers and technology growing up, and that had a great influence on my education ambitions. I started out as a web developer at the Art Institute of California â€“ Inland Empire, and became a student worker in the Technology department.

I assisted the Technology Department by creating web-based tools that simplify bar code and asset tag creation for equipment checkout and check in, and served the campus by operating a technology service window where students could print their projects and check out equipment relevant to their major. I also assisted IT department during campus off-hours in computer maintenance.

After that, I landed an internship at KVCR/FNX in San Bernardino. They loved me enough to keep me, and since then Iâ€™ve been responsible for upkeep, maintenance and theme creation / functionality on WordPress Installations, and am in charge of several servers including a Wowza server that serves our audience with 24/7 live access to our content. Occasionally, I service broadcast equipment and perform IT services.
